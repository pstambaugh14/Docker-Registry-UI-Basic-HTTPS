#Working Example of a non-interactive return of command into stdout (host box's terminal session.)
#This will run the given command into every running Docker container."

	#Creates a variable named $line - 'arr' array that retrieves the $i element - IE - sets array from each line in file and indexes and assigns string as variable per $line.
	arr[$i]="$line"
	#The Docker execuction command using only -t to return from psuedo-tty data to host stdout into newly formed line variable (in this case, the container ID/hostname).
	#bin/sh -c needs to be called in order to perform the correct functions via shell.  Then, finally the actual non-interactive command we're running:
	#docker exec -t "${line}" /bin/sh -c 'cat /etc/hostname' #Change 'cat /etc/hostname' to change the non-interactive command desired to be run. 
        echo "Stopping container "${line}"..." 
	docker stop "${line}" 
	echo "Removing container "${line}"..."
	docker rm "${line}"
	### Apparently: /bin/bash -l could work at times as well, although the demo was specific to a 'run', NOT 'exec' instance of Docker's CLI. ###
